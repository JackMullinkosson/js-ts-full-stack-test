If you want to run on local, make sure to replace the url in the useEffect function in src/pages/MonitoringPointsList.tsx and src/pages/index.tsx with http://localhost:3000/api/auth/login and to add the env files I sent in an email to Gustavo.

Assumptions:

Upon deletion of a machine, the user also intends to delete the associated monitoring points.

Upon creation of a monitoring point, the user wants to view the list of monitoring points.
